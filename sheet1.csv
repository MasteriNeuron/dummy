Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Piyush Prajapati: .transform is what perform the sir ?
Shubham Chaudhary: in which reference?
Piyush Prajapati: in sir machine learning
Piyush Prajapati: sir
Piyush Prajapati: ('num_pipeline',num_pipeline,numerical_cols), here 'num_pipline' is instance right ? sir
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, that's correct. In this context, num_pipeline is an instance of the Pipeline class that has been defined earlier in the code. It is a pipeline that consists of a series of steps for processing the numerical features of the dataset.
Piyush Prajapati: what num_pipline, and numerical_col ?
Shubham Chaudhary: num_pipeline is an instance of the Pipeline class that is created to perform numerical transformations on the selected numerical columns of the dataset. It is defined using the Pipeline class from the sklearn.pipeline module.
Shubham Chaudhary: In the ('num_pipeline', num_pipeline, numerical_cols) tuple, the first element 'num_pipeline' is the name or identifier of the pipeline step, the second element num_pipeline is the instance of the Pipeline class created to perform numerical transformations, and the third element numerical_cols is the list of column names containing numerical data.
Piyush Prajapati: sir i think first one is instance
Piyush Prajapati: because we create the instance ' ' within that
Piyush Prajapati: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, you are correct. In the statement 'num_pipeline', 'num_pipeline' is an instance of the class 'Pipeline' that we created earlier.
Piyush Prajapati: but sir that the second one we use ?
Shubham Chaudhary: numerical_cols is a list of column names that contain numerical features in the dataset. It is used to select only the numerical columns from the DataFrame in the ColumnTransformer and apply the transformation specified in the num_pipeline instance to these columns.<br /><br />In the code you provided earlier, numerical_cols is passed as the third argument to the ColumnTransformer constructor. This is used to specify the columns that should be selected for the num_pipeline transformation.
Piyush Prajapati: ok

This dataset contains email messages, where the goal is to predict whether a message<br />is spam or not based on several input features.<br />Implementation:<br />Implement Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers using the<br />scikit-learn library in Python. Use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each classifier on the<br />dataset. You should use the default hyperparameters for each classifier.<br />Results:<br />Report the following performance metrics for each classifier:<br />Accuracy<br />Precision<br />Recall<br />F1 score<br />Discussion:<br />Discuss the results you obtained. Which variant of Naive Bayes performed the best? Why do you think that is<br />the case? Are there any limitations of Naive Bayes that you observed?<br />Conclusion:<br />Summarise your findings and provide some suggestions for future work.
Rukhsana Shehla: i have loaded the dataset
Rukhsana Shehla: import pandas as pd<br />from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB, GaussianNB<br />from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score<br />import warnings<br />warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')<br /><br /># Load the dataset<br />data = pd.read_csv(""spambase.data"")<br /><br />data.head()

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Gunjan Matta: hi...i want to know how to choose a model based on the size of data set..i have googled but could not understand
Gunjan Matta: and somebody asked me question that we use regularization and cross validation to deal with multicolinearity....if we keep multicolinear functions what would happen
Gunjan Matta: i hope u will clear these doubts
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Gunjan Matta: ok
Shubham Chaudhary:  Generally, when working with a small dataset, simpler models may be preferred to avoid overfitting, which can occur when a model is too complex for the available data. On the other hand, when working with a large dataset, more complex models may be able to capture more nuanced relationships between the features and the target variable.
Shubham Chaudhary: One approach to selecting a model based on the size of the dataset is to use a complexity parameter, such as the regularization strength in regularized linear regression models (e.g., Lasso or Ridge regression). 
Shubham Chaudhary: Regarding multicollinearity, which is the presence of strong correlations between the predictor variables in a regression model, it can lead to unstable or unreliable coefficient estimates.
Gunjan Matta: ok...i read somewhere that if dataset is small,then we should choose a model with high bias and low variance
Gunjan Matta: i didn't understand how
Gunjan Matta: so unreliable coffiecients means my error would increase
Shubham Chaudhary: when working with a small dataset, a model with high bias and low variance is preferred to avoid overfitting and improve generalization performance. However, the optimal bias-variance tradeoff may depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the modeling task.
Gunjan Matta: thats what i didn't understand ....how bias and low variance would be helpful in small dataset and vice versa in larger dataset
Shubham Chaudhary: you know overfitting?
Gunjan Matta: yes
Shubham Chaudhary: if you know that ,,then to avoid this one ..
Shubham Chaudhary: we are using that
Shubham Chaudhary: simple
Gunjan Matta: ok now i got it :)
Gunjan Matta: thanks
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Gunjan Matta: and multicollinearity unreliable cofficients means increased error??
Gunjan Matta: as i gave this answer and the person who asked the question said ...acha ...error would increase???
Gunjan Matta: he was not satisfied..thats why just wanted to clarify
Shubham Chaudhary: and multicollinearity unreliable cofficients means increased error??  yes
Gunjan Matta: ok...thank u:)

Shivam Tyagi: It is compulsory to use standard scaler in Linear regression. If not then when we use standardscaler in Linear regression or when not.
Shubham Chaudhary: It is not compulsory to use StandardScaler in Linear Regression, but it is often recommended as it can improve the performance and accuracy of the model in certain situations.

Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Piyush Prajapati: both fit method is perform the different operation in the LinearRegression() and StanderdScaler()...?
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, both LinearRegression() and StandardScaler() perform different operations in machine learning.
Piyush Prajapati: In the StandardScaler() .fit perform mean and SD right
Piyush Prajapati: but what .fit() perform in the LinearRegression>
Piyush Prajapati: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, that's correct. In StandardScaler().fit(X), the fit method calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature in the dataset X along the rows (i.e., across the samples) and stores them in the scaler object. 
Shubham Chaudhary: It takes in the training data as input and tries to find the coefficients of the linear equation (slope and intercept) that best fits the data. The coefficients are calculated using the least squares method to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the predicted and actual target values.
Piyush Prajapati: ok sir understand
Shubham Chaudhary: in short: In LinearRegression, .fit() performs the training of the model using the input data and corresponding output data. It estimates the coefficients of the linear equation.
Piyush Prajapati: means find the slope of the ..? of the best fit line
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, that's correct. LinearRegression().fit() finds the slope and intercept of the line that best fits the input data using the method of least squares.
Piyush Prajapati: thank sir understand

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Rukhsana Shehla: in the question
Rukhsana Shehla: Q6. SVM Implementation through Iris dataset.<br />~ Load the iris dataset from the scikit-learn library and split it into a training set and a testing setl<br />~ Train a linear SVM classifier on the training set and predict the labels for the testing setl<br />~ Compute the accuracy of the model on the testing setl<br />~ Plot the decision boundaries of the trained model using two of the featuresl<br />~ Try different values of the regularisation parameter C and see how it affects the performance of<br />the model.<br />Bonus task: Implement a linear SVM classifier from scratch using Python and compare its<br />performance with the scikit-learn implementation.
Rukhsana Shehla: i am not able to do  Plot the decision boundaries of the trained model using two of the featuresl
Shubham Chaudhary: ook
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Shubham Chaudhary: https://codeshare.io/qP4MzR
Shubham Chaudhary: go with this
Rukhsana Shehla: sir, in the line accuracy = np.mean(y_pred == y_test)
Rukhsana Shehla: why y_pred == y_test has been mentioned?
Shubham Chaudhary: In the line accuracy = np.mean(y_pred == y_test), we are comparing the predicted labels (y_pred) to the true labels (y_test) and computing the mean of the resulting boolean array. This gives us the proportion of correctly classified samples in the test set.
Shubham Chaudhary: The expression y_pred == y_test returns a boolean array of the same length as y_test, where each element is True if the corresponding element in y_pred is equal to the corresponding element in y_test, and False otherwise.
Rukhsana Shehla: but we don't always <br />find the accuracy by comparing the values and then find the mean
Shubham Chaudhary: Comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels and computing the mean is a common way to evaluate the accuracy of a classifier. However, there are other evaluation metrics that can be used depending on the problem at hand.
Rukhsana Shehla: got ur point...thanks
Rukhsana Shehla: sir, can u explain me these two lines?
Rukhsana Shehla: X_new = np.c_[x0.ravel(), x1.ravel()]<br />y_pred = svm_clf.predict(X_new).reshape(x0.shape)
Shubham Chaudhary: X_new is a two-dimensional array that contains all possible combinations of x0 and x1 coordinates, where x0 is a set of evenly spaced values between 4 and 8, and x1 is a set of evenly spaced values between 0 and 7.
Shubham Chaudhary: after that]
Shubham Chaudhary: np.c_ is a function from the NumPy library that translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis. 
Shubham Chaudhary: x0.ravel() and x1.ravel() are used to convert the two-dimensional arrays x0 and x1 to one-dimensional arrays, which are then concatenated using np.c_. The ravel method is used to flatten the array along its rows.
Shubham Chaudhary: Next, the trained SVM classifier svm_clf is used to predict the labels of each point in the grid
Shubham Chaudhary: The predicted labels are stored in a one-dimensional array y_pred, which is then reshaped to match the shape of x0 using the reshape method. 
Shubham Chaudhary: the resulting array y_pred contains the predicted labels for each point in the grid, and is used to plot the decision boundaries of the trained model.
Shubham Chaudhary: that's it..
Rukhsana Shehla: sir, what does this statement means?
Rukhsana Shehla: np.c_ is a function from the NumPy library that translates slice objects to concatenation along the second axis.
Shubham Chaudhary: it is a definition of np.c function
Rukhsana Shehla: can u please explain this definition, i haven't understood the def

Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Priyanka: actually im searching for block in python but i can not get proper answer. please tell me the block in python
Shubham Chaudhary: In Python, a block of code is a set of statements that are grouped together and executed as a unit. Blocks of code are defined by their indentation level, and this is one of the features that makes Python different from other programming languages.<br /><br />In Python, a block of code is defined by a colon (:) followed by an indented set of statements. For example, consider the following code:
Shubham Chaudhary: if x > 0:<br />    print(""x is positive"")<br />else:<br />    print(""x is not positive"")<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: In this code, the block of code following the if statement is indented and contains the statement print(""x is positive""). The block of code following the else statement is also indented and contains the statement print(""x is not positive""). These indented blocks of code are executed only if their corresponding conditions are met.
Shubham Chaudhary: any other thing?
Priyanka: no thank you

Shubham Chaudhary: Validating a decision tree model is an important step in the machine learning workflow, as it helps to ensure that the model is accurate and robust to changes in the dataset or environment. There are several methods for validating a decision tree model, including applying it to new data and testing its robustness to changes in the dataset or environment using sensitivity analysis and scenario testing.

Karnati Sharath Chandra: has highly , what i am thinking is
Karnati Sharath Chandra: if age is increasing years of marriage will be incresse right
Karnati Sharath Chandra: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: It is possible that there could be a positive correlation between age and years of marriage, which would mean that as age increases, the number of years of marriage also tends to increase. However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation.
Karnati Sharath Chandra: i can remove right
Karnati Sharath Chandra: age right ?
Shubham Chaudhary: do some more analysis

Karnati Sharath Chandra: good morning , i have a small question
Shubham Chaudhary: good morning sir!!
Shubham Chaudhary: i have a small question;;;aks
Shubham Chaudhary: ask
Karnati Sharath Chandra: in logistic regression assignment
Karnati Sharath Chandra: i need to lady has affair  or not
Karnati Sharath Chandra: i need to predict lady has affair or not
Karnati Sharath Chandra: here the case is 0 means no affair , 1 means affiar
Karnati Sharath Chandra: 0 has 4325
Karnati Sharath Chandra: 1 has 2383
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Karnati Sharath Chandra: so i need to concentrate on 0 right there
Karnati Sharath Chandra: cos it is imblanced dataset
Karnati Sharath Chandra: can i use down sampling ? to over come imbalance dataset?
Karnati Sharath Chandra: hi
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Karnati Sharath Chandra: can we connect through meet if u domt mind ?
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, down-sampling can be a useful technique for dealing with imbalanced datasets in logistic regression.
Shubham Chaudhary: Since you mentioned that the majority class (0, indicating no affair) is much more prevalent than the minority class (1, indicating an affair), down-sampling involves randomly removing samples from the majority class to reduce its prevalence in the dataset. This can help to balance the number of samples in each class and prevent the logistic regression model from being biased towards the majority class.
Karnati Sharath Chandra: ok thanks
Shubham Chaudhary: After down-sampling, you can fit the logistic regression model on the balanced dataset, and then evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It is also recommended to use cross-validation to validate the performance of the model on multiple folds of the data.
Karnati Sharath Chandra: i understand , basically , i should focus on zero right
Karnati Sharath Chandra: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Karnati Sharath Chandra: even in precison r recall
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, since the majority class (0) is more prevalent in your imbalanced dataset, you should focus on optimizing the performance of your logistic regression model on that class.<br /><br />This means that when evaluating the performance of the model using metrics such as precision and recall, you should pay particular attention to the scores for the minority class (1) as well, but the overall goal should be to achieve high precision and recall for the majority class (0).
Karnati Sharath Chandra: ok thankls
Shubham Chaudhary: yes

Shubham Chaudhary: what is it?
Kripa Sindhu Saha: It's some jupyter notebook error ?

Kripa Sindhu Saha: ""NameError: name 'os_path' is not defined"" ?
Kripa Sindhu Saha: Have you seen this before, or can you understand it ?
Kripa Sindhu Saha: it's not letting me create any new Notebooks
Shubham Chaudhary: This error usually occurs when the Python interpreter does not recognize the name 'os', which is the Python module for interacting with the operating system. This could happen if the module was not imported properly or if there is a typo in the code.<br /><br />To fix the issue, make sure that the 'os' module is imported properly in your code, and check for any typos in your code that may have caused this error.
Kripa Sindhu Saha: i don't think this is 'os' module, since ive not used the os module in this notebook

Sambhav Mehta: r"" is re is like f"" in format?
Shubham Chaudhary: No, re.compile() is not like f""..."" in format.<br /><br />re.compile() is a function from Python's built-in re module, which is used to create a regular expression object. The regular expression object can then be used to match patterns in strings using methods like search() and findall().
Shubham Chaudhary: On the other hand, f""..."" is a string formatting feature introduced in Python 3.6, which allows you to embed expressions inside string literals by prefixing them with the letter ""f"". The expressions inside the curly braces {} are evaluated at runtime, and their values are inserted into the string.

Shubham Chaudhary: [0-9]+: Matches one or more digits (0 to 9).<br />(\\.[0-9]+)?: This is a group that matches a decimal point (\\.) followed by one or more digits (0 to 9) ([0-9]+). The ? at the end of the group makes it optional, so it matches zero or one occurrences of this group.<br />[a-zA-Z]*: Matches zero or more occurrences of any alphabetic character, either lowercase or uppercase.<br />K views: Matches the string ""K views"".
Sambhav Mehta: ok
Sambhav Mehta: what is difference btw re.findall and re.compile?
Sambhav Mehta: vid_titles = re.findall('""title"":{""runs"":\\[{""text"":"".*?""', response_text)
Sambhav Mehta: both these statements are doing the same thing, right?
Shubham Chaudhary: n summary, re.compile() is used to compile a regular expression pattern into a pattern object, while re.findall() is used to search for all occurrences of a pattern in a string and return a list of all matches.
Shubham Chaudhary: both these statements are doing the same thing, right?;; one is for compile and other is search

Piyush Prajapati: alternative : str<br />    The alternative hypothesis, H1, has to be one of the following<br /><br />       'two-sided': H1: difference in means not equal to value (default)<br />       'larger' :   H1: difference in means larger than value<br />       'smaller' :  H1: difference in means smaller than value what is this define in the ztest ? function
Shubham Chaudhary: The ztest() function is used to perform a one-sample z-test for the mean of a population or for the difference between two population means, given the population standard deviation.
Shubham Chaudhary: The alternative parameter in the ztest() function is used to specify the alternative hypothesis. It determines the direction of the test and the type of conclusion we can make based on the result.
Piyush Prajapati: when use a larger and samller ?
Shubham Chaudhary: You can use the 'larger' alternative when you are interested in determining whether a population mean is significantly larger than a given value.
Shubham Chaudhary: On the other hand, you can use the 'smaller' alternative when you are interested in determining whether a population mean is significantly smaller than a given value.
Shubham Chaudhary: It's important to note that the choice of alternative hypothesis should be based on the specific research question and hypothesis being tested.
Piyush Prajapati: given value what ?
Shubham Chaudhary: The value referred to in the alternative hypothesis depends on the specific research question being investigated.
Piyush Prajapati: given value what ?
Piyush Prajapati: what type of given value ?
Shubham Chaudhary: For example, if you want to test whether a new drug treatment is significantly more effective than the existing treatment, the value in the alternative hypothesis would be the mean difference you expect between the two treatments based on prior research or clinical knowledge.
Piyush Prajapati: please explin in the hindi sir if possible
Shubham Chaudhary: In general, the value in the alternative hypothesis should be based on prior knowledge or assumptions about the population mean or mean difference being tested.
Shubham Chaudhary: please explin in the hindi sir if possible:  use google translator
Piyush Prajapati: to answer bhi youtube pe search karlunga no problem
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: how can i write hindi here?
Piyush Prajapati: ok i understood sir
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Piyush Prajapati: no problme
Shubham Chaudhary: try to understand..
Piyush Prajapati: and value attribute is what in the ztest ?
Piyush Prajapati: value is the mean of x1 ?
Shubham Chaudhary: If you are performing a one-sample z-test for the mean of a single population, the value attribute should be set to the hypothesized population mean.<br /><br />If you are performing a two-sample z-test for the difference between two population means, the value attribute should be set to the hypothesized difference between the two population mean

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Himanshu: hi shubham
Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Himanshu: i am using python in anaconda env. on jupyter notebook. in my official laptop. but i am not able to download any packages like pandas profile , dtale etc.
Himanshu sent 7bbdf8a5-2f71-42ce-8f65-81ff83d6442e.png 
Shubham Chaudhary: its just warning
Shubham Chaudhary: no issue;
Himanshu: no but pandas profiling is not working
Shubham Chaudhary: pandas profiling is a online library, it will take times to made profile;
Shubham Chaudhary: so for better one,use lab
Himanshu: it is giving SSL certification error
Himanshu: lab?
Shubham Chaudhary: pwlab
Shubham Chaudhary: or neuro lan
Shubham Chaudhary: lab
Himanshu: only jupyter notebook is allowed in my company. can u explain me what is SSL certification error and how i can solve this?
Shubham Chaudhary: An SSL certificate error occurs when your web browser (or other client software) encounters an issue with the SSL/TLS certificate presented by the web server. SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between the client and the server, and are a critical component of secure web browsing and other online activities.
Shubham Chaudhary: mainly TIMEOUT ISSUE;
Himanshu: then how i can solve this?
Shubham Chaudhary: o solve this error, you can take the following steps:<br /><br />Check the URL: Make sure you are connecting to the correct URL and that it is spelled correctly. Sometimes, typing in the wrong URL can lead to SSL certificate errors.<br /><br />Check the date and time on your computer: Ensure that the date and time on your computer are set correctly. If they are not, SSL certificate validation may fail.<br /><br />Update your web browser: Make sure your web browser is up to date. Outdated web browsers may not recognize the SSL/TLS certificates of some websites.<br /><br />Install the necessary SSL/TLS certificates: Sometimes, you may need to install the necessary SSL/TLS certificates on your computer to establish a secure connection. This is more common in corporate environments where IT policies may limit the use of certain websites or services.
Himanshu: ok so what i should tell to my IT team ?
Shubham Chaudhary: no..use a pc with good configurations;
Shubham Chaudhary: and if you are using pandas profiking, then having good internet connection too
Himanshu: i am using i7 12 gen, 32 gb ram laptop . with high speed internet conectivity. but this is corporate laptop .
Shubham Chaudhary:  i7 12 gen, 32 gb ram laptop .;;its fine;
Shubham Chaudhary: then connect with team;
Himanshu: can i call you?

Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: Install the Python extension by going to the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X or View -> Extensions) and searching for ""Python"". Click the ""Install"" button next to the ""Python"" extension.<br /><br />After installing the Python extension, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or View -> Command Palette) and search for ""Python: Select Interpreter"". This command allows you to select the Python interpreter you want to use for your project.<br /><br />If Anaconda is installed correctly, you should see the Anaconda Python interpreter listed in the drop-down menu. Select it and click ""OK"".<br /><br />Create a new Python file or open an existing one in Visual Studio Code.<br /><br />You should see a blue status bar at the bottom of the window that says ""Python 3.x.x (conda)"". This indicates that Visual Studio Code is using the Anaconda Python interpreter.<br /><br />You can now use the full power of Anaconda in Visual Studio Code, including its package management system (conda) and its many pre-installed scientific libraries.<br /><br />That's it! You should now be able to use Anaconda with Visual Studio Code.

Devi: data science master
Shubham Chaudhary: In Python, ""magic methods"" are special methods with double underscores (also known as ""dunder"" methods) that define how instances of a class behave with respect to certain operations, such as arithmetic, comparison, and container operations.<br /><br />While it is not necessarily ""bad"" to use magic methods, it is important to use them judiciously and only when they are appropriate for the task at hand. Overuse of magic methods can make code harder to read and understand, and can also make it more difficult to maintain and debug.

Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Jaideep: while printing 5/2 , if any one is made float by doing 5.0/2 than in second case both 5.0 and 2.0 are treated as float , so similarly if we are doing the same with one data type as float and other as double than will the compiler treat both  of them as double (that is the larger data type)?
Jaideep: in above question it 2 and not 2.0
Shubham Chaudhary: is it in c++?
Jaideep: yes
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, in C and C++, if you perform an arithmetic operation between a float and a double, the compiler will promote the float to a double before performing the operation. This is because double has a higher precision than float and can represent larger and more precise numbers.
Shubham Chaudhary: ex:
Shubham Chaudhary: float a = 5.0f;<br />double b = 2.0;<br />double c = a + b;<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: The compiler will promote the float value of a to a double before adding it to b, and the result will be stored in the double variable c.
Jaideep: also if instead of writing number if we store than number in a variable than will it work?
Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, you can store the values in variables and perform arithmetic operations on them. The data types of the variables will determine the precision of the calculations.

Zamiq: i need to convert my pandas dataframe to pyspark for millions of records and write into hive external table
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Shubham Chaudhary: you could use to convert a Pandas DataFrame to PySpark and write it to a Hive external table:<br /><br />First, you'll need to create a PySpark DataFrame from the Pandas DataFrame. You can use the createDataFrame() method of the SparkSession object to do this:
Shubham Chaudhary: from pyspark.sql import SparkSession<br />import pandas as pd<br /><br /># Create a SparkSession<br />spark = SparkSession.builder.appName('PandasToSpark').getOrCreate()<br /><br /># Load the Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file<br />df_pandas = pd.read_csv('/path/to/my/file.csv')<br /><br /># Convert the Pandas DataFrame to a PySpark DataFrame<br />df_spark = spark.createDataFrame(df_pandas)<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: Once you have the PySpark DataFrame, you can write it to a Hive external table using the saveAsTable() method:
Shubham Chaudhary: # Write the PySpark DataFrame to a Hive external table<br />df_spark.write.saveAsTable('my_external_table', mode='overwrite', format='parquet', path='/path/to/my/hive_table')<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: follow these steps
Zamiq: df_spark = spark.createDataFrameis not working for huge dataset
Zamiq: hi
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Zamiq: df_spark = spark.createDataFrameis not working for huge dataset
Shubham Chaudhary: df = spark.read.format(""csv"").option(""header"", ""true"").load(""my_huge_file.csv"")<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: use this once

Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
PABBATHI BHANU PRAKASH: kk
Shubham Chaudhary: a generator function is a special type of function in Python that uses the yield keyword to produce a sequence of values on the fly, rather than returning a single value. Generator functions are useful when you need to generate a large sequence of values but don't want to store them all in memory at once.
Shubham Chaudhary: example of a simple generator function
Shubham Chaudhary: def my_generator(start, end):<br />    current = start<br />    while current <= end:<br />        yield current<br />        current += 1<br />
PABBATHI BHANU PRAKASH: I am sry to hesitate you......sir didnt explain this topic.....thats why I am asing you
PABBATHI BHANU PRAKASH: can u explain the above code in a call please
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Shubham Chaudhary: the my_generator() function takes two arguments, start and end, which define the range of integers to generate. Inside the function, we initialize a variable current to start, and then use a while loop to generate integers from start to end one at a time. The yield keyword is used to ""yield"" each integer as it is generated, allowing the calling code to iterate over the sequence of values.
PABBATHI BHANU PRAKASH: I will share my screen .....can you explain
Shubham Chaudhary: one person already sharing
Shubham Chaudhary: what are you not getting
Shubham Chaudhary: in it;

Shubham Chaudhary: line no 1: we are importing base,html
Shubham Chaudhary: Extends 'base.html'<br />The extends keyword is used to indicate that the current template extends another template, which in this case is 'base.html'. This means that the content of 'base.html' will be used as a base layout for this template. The content of the current template will be inserted into the appropriate sections of 'base.html', as defined by the block tags.<br /><br />Block head<br />The {% block head %} tag defines a block with the name ""head"". This block will be filled in with content specific to this template, and will replace the {% block head %} tag in the base template. This is useful for defining page-specific CSS or JavaScript files, meta tags, or any other content that belongs in the head section of an HTML document.

Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Anubhav Tiwari: why we use yield in function
Anubhav Tiwari: yeild is like a return ?
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Shubham Chaudhary: The yield keyword in Python is used in generator functions to create a generator object. A generator is a type of iterator that can be iterated over using a for loop or by calling the next() function on the generator object.
Shubham Chaudhary: When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function's body. The body of the function is executed only when the generator's next() method is called. When the yield keyword is encountered in the function, the current value of the expression after the yield is returned by the next() method, and the function's execution is paused at that point.
Shubham Chaudhary: So, while yield and return are both used to return values from a function, they have different uses and behaviors. yield is used to create a generator, while return is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller.
Shubham Chaudhary: are you there?
Anubhav Tiwari: thank you

Shubham Chaudhary: copy it and paste here

Sandhya Dubba: AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'int'.<br />`np.int` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `int`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `int` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. When replacing `np.int`, you may wish to use e.g. `np.int64` or `np.int32` to specify the precision. If you wish to review your current use, check the release note link for additional information.<br />The aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:<br />    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations

Manoj Sahoo: so my question over here is how i can load the it
Manoj Sahoo: suppoesee noof hour stydnet studies x=9,
Manoj Sahoo: x=9,5,6,7and y is the they fot out of 100 y=90,50,60,70
Shubham Chaudhary: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: no
Manoj Sahoo: so are got what i am trying to say
Shubham Chaudhary: share the question once;
Manoj Sahoo: Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.
Manoj Sahoo: here the question
Manoj Sahoo: value of x= no of our student stuies for their exam =9,5,6,7      and   y=th e score they got out of 100=  90,50,60 70 respectively
Manoj Sahoo: so first tell me am i interpret th e question correctly or not

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

MONU: what are<br /> global and local variables
MONU: scope*
MONU: ??
Shubham Chaudhary: in c++
Shubham Chaudhary: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: In C++, a variable's scope determines its accessibility within a program. A variable can be either a global variable or a local variable.<br /><br />A global variable is declared outside of any function, and it can be accessed from any part of the program. A global variable is initialized once, and its value remains the same throughout the program. Global variables can be declared using the extern keyword in a header file and defined in a source file.<br /><br />For example:
Shubham Chaudhary: // Global variable<br />int g_var = 10;<br /><br />int main() {<br />   // Access global variable<br />   std::cout << ""Global variable value: "" << g_var << std::endl;<br />   return 0;<br />}<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: A local variable is declared inside a function or a block, and it can only be accessed within that function or block. A local variable is initialized every time the function or block is called, and its value is not retained between function calls.
Shubham Chaudhary: int main() {<br />   // Local variable<br />   int l_var = 20;<br />   std::cout << ""Local variable value: "" << l_var << std::endl;<br />   return 0;<br />}<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: In general, it is good practice to use local variables when possible to avoid name clashes and improve code clarity. However, global variables can be useful in certain situations, such as when multiple functions need to share data or when constants need to be defined.

Rohan: I was solving 10 mar assignment. Getting confused in numerical, when to use z test and t test
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: what is the confusion
Rohan: for like q3 q14 what to use
Rohan: z test or t test
Shubham Chaudhary: share questions
Shubham Chaudhary: once
Rohan: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y2dJu_b5pTq20-SmjcTUqtasmDPfQIs0
Shubham Chaudhary: Q13. A coffee shop owner wants to estimate the average daily revenue for their shop. They take a random<br />sample of 50 days and find the sample mean revenue to be $500 with a standard deviation of $50.<br />Estimate the population mean revenue with a 95% confidence interval.<br />Q14. A researcher hypothesizes that a new drug will decrease blood pressure by 10 mmHg. They conduct a<br />clinical trial with 100 patients and find that the sample mean decrease in blood pressure is 8 mmHg with a<br />standard deviation of 3 mmHg. Test the hypothesis with a significance level of 0.05. 
Shubham Chaudhary: is it?
Rohan: yes
Rohan: how to decide which test to be used
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Shubham Chaudhary: In practice, the population standard deviation is often unknown, and so a t-test is typically used. However, if the sample size is large (i.e., n > 30), the t-distribution becomes very similar to the standard normal distribution, and a z-test can be used even if the population standard deviation is unknown.<br /><br />In summary, use a z-test if the population standard deviation is known and a t-test if it is unknown. If the sample size is large, a z-test can be used even if the population standard deviation is unknown.
Shubham Chaudhary: follow this
Rohan: So, I'd used z test for q14 as sample size was 100, so is this correct?
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Rohan: ok,thans

Shubham Chaudhary: go with this
Sridevi: Ok,
Sridevi: i have one more doubt
Sridevi: Can we build recommendation system using SQL queries?
Sridevi: what difference does it make from ML one?
Sridevi: I can bring data from tables, based on users using SQL right?
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Shubham Chaudhary: 2 mint
Shubham Chaudhary: While SQL can be used to analyze and manipulate data, it may not be the most effective tool for building a recommendation system compared to machine learning (ML) techniques.
Shubham Chaudhary: SQL is mainly used for managing and querying structured data stored in databases. You can use SQL queries to extract data from tables, filter data based on certain conditions, join data from different tables, and aggregate data to derive insights. For example, you can use SQL queries to find the most popular products, the highest revenue-generating customers, or the most active users on a platform.
Shubham Chaudhary: However, building a recommendation system requires more than just querying data. Recommendation systems typically use machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior, identify patterns, and make predictions. They typically involve training a model on large amounts of data, identifying similarities between users and items, and using those similarities to make personalized recommendations. While it's possible to use SQL to prepare data for a recommendation system, the actual process of building the system typically requires more advanced techniques.
Shubham Chaudhary: In summary, while SQL can be used to extract and analyze data from databases, building a recommendation system typically requires more advanced techniques such as machine learning. While SQL can be a useful tool for preparing data for a recommendation system, the actual process of building the system typically involves more advanced technique;
Shubham Chaudhary: any other doubt?

What is the margin of error for this interval? 1.82.32.83.4Explanation: The margin of error is half of the width of the confidence interval. Therefore, the margin of error is (28.2-24.6)/2 = 1.8, which is closest to option b) 2.3.

Pritam: Q4. Describe the process of feature engineering in the context of the student performance data set. How<br />did you select and transform the variables for your model?
Pritam: hi , here it want feture selection method ?
Shubham Chaudhary: WAIT
Shubham Chaudhary: WILL DISCUSS
Pritam: or it ask for encoding only ?
Shubham Chaudhary: TO eda
Shubham Chaudhary: ALL THINGS
Shubham Chaudhary: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The first step is to explore the data set and understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns in the data. This can be done using various visualization and statistical techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, and summary statistics. EDA helps identify potential variables that are strongly correlated with the outcome variable (e.g., academic performance) and may be good candidates for feature engineering.<br /><br />Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Next, we need to clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables. This may involve imputation, scaling, normalization, one-hot encoding, and other techniques to prepare the data for feature engineering.<br /><br />Feature Selection: Feature selection involves selecting the most relevant features from the original data set that are likely to be predictive of the outcome variable. This can be done using various statistical and machine learning techniques such as correlation analysis, feature importance ranking, and recursive feature elimination.<br /><br />Feature Transformation: Feature transformation involves transforming the selected features into new features that are more informative and useful for the machine learning model. This may involve various techniques such as scaling, normalization, polynomial expansion, and feature interaction. For example, we can create new features such as the average of math and reading scores or the difference between parents' education levels.<br /><br />Feature Extraction: Feature extraction involves deriving new features from existing features using domain-specific knowledge and expertise. This may involve applying various algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and other dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the complexity of the data set.<br /><br />Model Training and Validation: Finally, we need to train and validate a machine learning model using the transformed features. This may involve various techniques such as cross-validation, hyperparamete

Sambhav Mehta: hi
Sambhav Mehta: lambda function is only use in case of list?
Shubham Chaudhary: no;;use map too
Sambhav Mehta: what is the use of map function?
Shubham Chaudhary: No, lambda functions are not only used with lists. Lambda functions can be used wherever a function is needed in Python. A lambda function is simply a way of defining a small anonymous function in a single line of code without assigning it a name.<br /><br />Lambda functions are commonly used in conjunction with higher-order functions such as map(), filter(), and reduce() to process lists, tuples, and other iterable objects in a concise and efficient way. However, lambda functions can be used anywhere a regular function can be used, such as in function arguments or as return values from functions.
Shubham Chaudhary: read once;
Sambhav Mehta: iterable objects are basically lists, tuples, set and dictionaries, ri<br />ght?
Shubham Chaudhary: while lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries are iterable objects in Python, there are many other types of iterable objects that you can use in your code.
Shubham Chaudhary: other examples of iterable objects in Python include strings, ranges, files, and generator
Sambhav Mehta: ok
Sambhav Mehta: thanks
Sambhav Mehta: what is the use of reduce function?
Sambhav Mehta: and what is the use of map function?
Shubham Chaudhary: he reduce() function can be used for a wide range of applications, such as finding the maximum or minimum value in a list, concatenating strings, or computing a cumulative sum. 
Sambhav Mehta: so reduce is basically use for mathematical operation ?
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Sambhav Mehta: and map?
Shubham Chaudhary: not math only
Shubham Chaudhary: concatenating strings
Shubham Chaudhary: depends on requirement of problem
Shubham Chaudhary: you have to use it;
Shubham Chaudhary: please explore at google

Monika: what is bias and variance
Monika: and difference between them ???
Shubham Chaudhary: The difference between bias and variance is that bias measures the error introduced by approximating a real-life problem with a simplified model, while variance measures the variability of the model's predictions for different training sets. In general, there is a trade-off between bias and variance in model building. A model with high bias tends to have low variance, while a model with low bias tends to have high variance.

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Ankit: what is sample data and population data
Shubham Chaudhary: Population data refers to data that includes every member of a particular group or population being studied. For example, if you wanted to know the average height of all people in the United States, you would need to collect data on every single person living in the United States. This would be considered population data.<br /><br />Sample data, on the other hand, refers to a subset of the population data that is used to make inferences about the population as a whole. In our example of studying the average height of people in the United States, it would be impractical to collect data on every single person, so we might instead collect data on a smaller group of people, such as 1,000 randomly selected individuals. This smaller group of 1,000 individuals would be considered a sample data set, and we would use this data to make inferences about the entire population.
Shubham Chaudhary: did you get?
Shubham Chaudhary: for example: population data would be the entire student body of a university, while an example of sample data would be a randomly selected group of 100 students from that university. Another example would be a poll taken during a presidential election, where the population data would be the entire voting population of a country, while the sample data would be the responses of a randomly selected group of individuals who were polled.

Sayyad Abdul Bari: for underfitting , the training and testing accuracy both are low. so how can underfitted model performs well on new data
Shubham Chaudhary:  it is best to aim for a model that has high accuracy on both the training and testing data. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data and is likely to perform well on new data. If the model is underfit, then one approach to improving its performance is to increase its capacity, for example, by adding more layers or more neurons. This can help the model capture more complex patterns in the data and improve its generalization performance.

Arpit Jadon: I am stuck at an  assignment question will you help me?
Arpit Jadon: Q5. Create a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000. Use the next() method to print the<br />first 20 prime numbers.
Shubham Chaudhary: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: then what is issue?
Arpit Jadon: I think the code that I was writing is going wrong and the output is not as I expected.
Shubham Chaudhary: please copy the code that yyou write
Shubham Chaudhary: here
Arpit Jadon: ohk
Arpit Jadon: def prime():<br />    n=int(input(""enter a no. ""))<br />    l=[]<br />    for i in range(2,1000):<br />        if n%i!=0:<br />            l.append(i)<br />            yield n<br />primee=prime()<br />for i in range(1,21):<br />    print(next(primee))
Arpit Jadon: will you help me to understand the logic behind the problem?
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Arpit Jadon: thanks 👍
Shubham Chaudhary: To generate a sequence of prime numbers, we can use the fact that a number is prime if it is not divisible by any smaller prime number. Therefore, we can start with the first prime number, which is 2, and generate successive prime numbers by checking whether each odd number is divisible by any of the previously generated primes.<br /><br />The prime function in the corrected code accomplishes this by using a while loop to generate prime numbers until 20 primes have been generated. The loop initializes a variable num to 2, and then generates successive odd numbers by incrementing num by 1 in each iteration of the loop.<br /><br />For each odd number, the for loop inside the while loop checks whether the number is prime by testing whether it is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of the number (inclusive). If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, the break statement is executed, which breaks out of the for loop and proceeds to the next odd number. If the for loop completes without finding a divisor, then the number is prime and is yielded by the generator function.<br /><br />The for loop at the end of the code creates a generator object primee and calls the next function on the generator object 20 times to generate the first 20 prime numbers. The print statement then outputs each generated prime number.

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Arghya Chatterjee: [45,34,55,69,52,35,89,98,75]
Arghya Chatterjee: What will be the mode of this ?
Arghya Chatterjee: I want to know when each of elements occurs same time or just a single time. In that case what will be the mode?
Arghya Chatterjee: As we know that mode returns the maximum frequency's element
Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Shubham Chaudhary: wait i am seeing
Arghya Chatterjee: 🙁
Shubham Chaudhary: In the given list [45,34,55,69,52,35,89,98,75], there is no mode because no number appears more than once. 
Shubham Chaudhary: indefined
Shubham Chaudhary: So, the mode of this dataset is not defined.
Arghya Chatterjee: But the output , Jupyter returns, is
Arghya Chatterjee: ModeResult(mode=array([34]), count=array([1]))
Arghya Chatterjee: I wanna know if the elements of a dataset occur same no of time what will be the mode?
Arghya Chatterjee: 🙂
Shubham Chaudhary: You are correct that Jupyter is returning an output that shows the mode as 34 with a count of 1. This may seem counterintuitive given that all elements occur the same number of times, but it can be explained as follows:<br /><br />In the case where all elements in a dataset occur the same number of times, there is no unique mode. However, some statistical software packages, including SciPy which Jupyter likely uses, define the mode as the smallest value in the dataset if all elements occur the same number of times.<br /><br />Therefore, in your example dataset [45, 34, 55, 69, 52, 35, 89, 98, 75], since all values occur only once, the mode is defined as the smallest value in the dataset, which is 34. The count of 1 simply indicates that only one value in the dataset is the mode.<br /><br />So, in summary, although the dataset has no unique mode, the mode function in SciPy (which Jupyter is using) defines the mode as the smallest value in the dataset.
Arghya Chatterjee: Okay I got it, But besides Jupyter or Python , in Statistics there won't be mode. right?
Shubham Chaudhary: yes
Arghya Chatterjee: Okay ....
Arghya Chatterjee: Thank You
Shubham Chaudhary: please share the feedback;

Rutik Irdande: what is labled data and unlabeled data ?
Shubham Chaudhary: label means output(y) is also given with respect to input(x)
Shubham Chaudhary: Image\tLabel<br />Image 1\tCat<br />Image 2\tDog<br />Image 3\tCat<br />Image 4\tDog
Rutik Irdande: ok
Shubham Chaudhary: but in unlabeled ..output in not given (y),,and you have to find patteren
Shubham Chaudhary: in them;;
Rutik Irdande: like what,
Rutik Irdande: any exg.
Rutik Irdande: eg.
Shubham Chaudhary: wait;
Shubham Chaudhary: For example, you could use clustering algorithms to group customers who have similar purchase behavior together. This could help you identify different types of customers (e.g., frequent buyers, bargain hunters, etc.) and tailor your marketing strategies accordingly.
Rutik Irdande: ok

Rohit: first 1 :
Rohit: notes = 10<br />i = 0 # 1st note<br /><br />while i <= notes:<br />    i = i + 1<br />    print(f""current sum: {i*10}"")

Rohit: notes = 10<br />i = 1 # 1st note<br /><br />while i <= notes:<br />  print(f""current sum: {i*10}"")<br />  i = i + 1
Shubham Chaudhary: the main difference between the two code snippets is the order of the increment operation and the print statement within the while loop.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Shubham Chaudhary: The first code snippet increments the value of i before printing the current sum, while the second code snippet prints the current sum before incrementing the value of i.
Rohit: ohh ok should we give print statement imedietely after while loop
Shubham Chaudhary: its depends on usecase;
Shubham Chaudhary: if you want to print first befire increment then ;

Shubham Chaudhary: Putting these two together in the if __name__ == ""__main__"": block allows us to run the Flask application from the command line by running the script directly, without needing to import it as a module into another script. When the script is run, the Flask application will start listening for incoming requests on the specified host and port.

Devi: Can u please explain me to write program for checking the password
Shubham Chaudhary: The function takes a password as an input argument.<br />First, it checks the length of the password. If the length is not 10, it returns ""Invalid Password"".<br />Next, it uses regular expressions to count the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters in the password.<br />Finally, it checks if the password satisfies the given requirements (at least two uppercase letters, at least two lowercase letters, at least one digit, and at least three special characters). If the password satisfies all requirements, it returns ""Valid Password"". Otherwise, it returns ""Invalid Password"".

It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a ""batteries included"" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34]Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36]Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languagesc"""""" q5 : Try to generate all the even number between 1- 1000q6 : Define a function for all the above problem statememnt  .

Shubham Chaudhary: ?
Shubham Chaudhary: Firstly, you need to import the reduce() function from the functools module. Then, create a list of numbers from 1 to 25 using the range() function. Finally, pass the list to the reduce() function along with a lambda function that multiplies the current value with the next value.

Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Shubham Chaudhary: The code df[df.duplicated('App')] returns a subset of the DataFrame that contains only those rows where the App column has a duplicate value. This can be useful for identifying and removing duplicate entries from the dataset, especially if the App column is a key column or a column that should have unique values.

Shubham Chaudhary: Yes, that's correct. If the App column contains the name ""Photo Editor & Candy Camera & Grid & ScrapBook"" twice or more in the original dataframe, then the code ""df[df.duplicated('App')]"" would return a dataframe with only the rows that have this app name duplicated.

Suryansh Nema: in sample variance formula(xi-xbar)^2/n-1 we use n-1 in place of n because we make it ubasised estimator.why we make it unbaised estimator of population variance
Suryansh Nema: ?
Suryansh Nema: ??
Shubham Chaudhary: wait
Shubham Chaudhary: we use n - 1 instead of n to adjust for the fact that we are estimating the population variance based on a sample of data. This adjustment helps to make the estimate more accurate and less biased, by accounting for the uncertainty introduced by using a sample to estimate the population variance.
Shubham Chaudhary: any other query?
Suryansh Nema: can you explain the term unbiased estimator of population variance?
Shubham Chaudhary: an unbiased estimator of population variance is a formula or a function that gives us an estimate of the population variance that is not systematically higher or lower than the true population variance. This is important because it allows us to make accurate inferences about the population based on our sample data.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Shubham Chaudhary: one the link
Shubham Chaudhary: there is right code
Fariz Ali: okay but i asked what is the meaning of func() herw?
Shubham Chaudhary: func() means you are calling the function named as func()
Fariz Ali: There isnt a function named func there are only two functins as test1 and test2
Fariz Ali sent 736e4a03-0c46-483b-a32a-bd7ec2c1a382.png 
Shubham Chaudhary:  func() is used to call a function that was passed as an argument to another function. It's a way to execute the function that was passed in a dynamic way.
Shubham Chaudhary: example;
Shubham Chaudhary: def my_function():<br />    print(""Hello, world!"")<br /><br />def call_function(func):<br />    func()<br /><br />call_function(my_function)<br />
Shubham Chaudhary: The call_function function takes a function as an argument, and calls it using the func() syntax.
Shubham Chaudhary: When we call call_function(my_function), the my_function function is passed as an argument to call_function, which in turn calls it using func().
Fariz Ali: sure thanks
Shubham Chaudhary: welcome

Kalishwaran: i need an explanation for above code
Shubham Chaudhary: The data variable is a list of lists where each sub-list represents a row of data. The first sub-list contains the column names.<br /><br />The open() function is used to open a file called ""test3.csv"" in write mode. The file object is stored in the variable f.<br /><br />The csv.writer() function is used to create a writer object which will write the data to the CSV file. The writer object is stored in the variable w.<br /><br />A for loop is used to iterate over each row of data in the data variable. For each row, the writerow() method of the w object is called to write the row to the CSV file.<br /><br />After the for loop completes, the file object is automatically closed using the with statement.<br /><br />In summary, the code reads the data variable and writes it to a CSV file named ""test3.csv"" using the csv module. The resulting CSV file will have the column names in the first row, and the data in subsequent rows.

The requirement of the company is that you create a python<br />function that will check whether the password entered by the user is correct or not. The function should<br />take the password as input and return the string “Valid Password” if the entered password follows the<br />below-given password guidelines else it should return “Invalid Password”.<br />Note: 1. The Password should contain at least two uppercase letters and at least two lowercase letters.<br />2. The Password should contain at least a number and three special characters.<br />3. The length of the password should be 10 characters long.
