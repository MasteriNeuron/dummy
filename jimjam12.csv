Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Hello. How may I help you?

VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: 9.<br />Predict the output of following Java program<br /><br />class Main {<br /><br />   public static void main(String args[]) {<br /><br />      try {<br /><br />         throw 10;<br /><br />      }<br /><br />      catch(int e) {<br /><br />         System.out.println(""Got the  Exception "" + e);<br /><br />      }<br /><br />  }<br /><br />}<br /><br /><br />Got the Exception 10<br /><br /><br />Got the Exception 0<br /><br /><br />Compile Error<br /><br /><br />Compiles and runs fine
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: why compile error
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: ??
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: otput
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: This is because the throw statement in the try block is throwing an int value of 10, which is not a valid exception type in Java. Therefore, the catch block with an int parameter cannot handle this exception and it remains unhandled.
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: ok
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: but in catch we are catching int e
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Yes, in the original code, the catch block is catching an int parameter, which is not a valid exception type in Java.
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: ok
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: if you want to catch all exceptions, you can catch the Exception class, which is the superclass of all exceptions in Java,
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: got it
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: ok
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Have you any other questions
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: 6.<br /> In which of the following package Exception class exist?<br /><br /><br />java.util<br /><br /><br />java.file<br /><br /><br />java.io<br /><br /><br />java.lang<br /><br /><br />java.ne
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: java.lang package
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: 7.<br />Given below code snippet<br /><br />interface A {<br /><br />     int aMethod(String s);<br /><br />}<br /><br /><br />A a = a -> a.length();<br /><br /><br />A x = y -> {return y;};<br /><br /><br />A s = ""2"" -> Integer.parseInt(s);<br /><br /><br />A b = (String s) -> 1;
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: cant get this one
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: Which among the following can show polymorphism?Overloading ||Overloading +=Overloading <<Overloading &&
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: another
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: it is present in our course 
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: lst 1
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: quiz
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: i dont understand
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: the explanation
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: provide there
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: it is present in our course
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: overloading<<
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: what that means
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: for
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: cant find anywhere
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: please
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: prove some hint to find
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where different methods with the same name can be called based on the parameters provided.
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: no
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: <<
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: what thismns
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: Which among the following can show polymorphism?Overloading ||Overloading +=Overloading <<Overloading &&
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: Which among the following can show polymorphism<br />Overloading ||<br />Overloading +=<br />Overloading <<<br /><br />Overloading &&
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: cant understand this one
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: When overloading || and && operators in a class, the behavior of the operator depends on the operands being used. This allows objects of the class to exhibit different behaviors based on the context in which they are used, thereby demonstrating polymorphism
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh:  overloading += (compound assignment) and overloading << (output stream) are not directly related to polymorphism.
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: üòß
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: need more
VIGHNESHWAR MISHRA: explanation
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: overloading the << operator in a class can demonstrate polymorphism by allowing objects of the class to exhibit different behaviors based on the context in which they are used.

Syed Abdul Quavi: dto layer, dao layer and in service layerI'm bit confused in that1)Basically controller is used as like contacting with the view part logic and 2)dto is used as a layer for  transferring object instead of real transfer of the business logic object as it is not a good approach and 3)the  main logic is written in service layer4) and  dao layer is for the persistence logic for the database part

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: write mail on query@ineuron.ai

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes you are correct  the controller layer handles the client requests, the DTO layer transfers data between layers, the service layer implements the business logic, and the DAO layer interacts with the database.

Ayaz Usmani: i have a doubt on hashset class in collection
Ayaz Usmani: when we insert any data in hashset buckets so how the data is stored in specific bucket
Ayaz Usmani: please reply sir
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: just wait
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: When you insert data into a HashSet, the HashSet uses a hash function to determine which bucket the data should be stored in.<br /><br />The hash function takes the data's value and produces a hash code, which is an integer value. The hash code is then used to determine the index of the bucket where the data should be stored.
Ayaz Usmani: so sir are there any kind of restrictions in  type of data that can be stored
Ayaz Usmani: sir please revert back
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: primitive data types such as int, float, double, etc., cannot be directly stored in a HashSet. They must be first wrapped in their corresponding object types, such as Integer, Float, Double, etc., before being stored in a HashSet.
Ayaz Usmani: yes sir i understand but i wanted to ask that how to store Strings, Char, Integer all in same Hashset.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: you can store Strings, Chars, and Integers all in the same HashSet by creating an instance of the HashSet class and adding objects of different types to it
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: import java.util.HashSet;<br /><br />public class Main {<br />  public static void main(String[] args) {<br />    HashSet<Object> hashSet = new HashSet<Object>();<br />    <br />    // Adding String object to the hashSet<br />    hashSet.add(""Hello"");<br />    <br />    // Adding Character object to the hashSet<br />    hashSet.add('c');<br />    <br />    // Adding Integer object to the hashSet<br />    hashSet.add(123);<br />    <br />    // Printing the hashSet<br />    System.out.println(hashSet);<br />  }<br />}<br />

Dhiraj Kumar: what is garbage collector ???
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Garbage Collector (GC) in Java is a component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that automatically manages the memory used by Java programs.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Java provides automatic memory management through the garbage collector, which reduces the burden on developers to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation.
Dhiraj Kumar: gc interally work karta h ??
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes it will work internally and collect unused objects memory,
Dhiraj Kumar: ohk
Dhiraj Kumar: ham kaise jaanege ki mera program me gc kaam kar rha ya nii
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Java provides automatic memory management through the garbage collector
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: it will work for all programs, not needed memory will collected by it.
Dhiraj Kumar: to kaise jaanege ki mera object destroy ho gya h??
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: it is automatic process 
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Let's say you have a Java program that creates a new object:
Dhiraj Kumar: yes
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: MyObject obj = new MyObject();<br />
Dhiraj Kumar: yes
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: the new keyword is used to create a new object of the MyObject class, and a reference to that object is stored in the obj variable.
Dhiraj Kumar: ha
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Now let's say that you no longer need this object in your program and you remove the reference to it:
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: obj = null;<br />
Dhiraj Kumar: haa
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh:  the null keyword is used to remove the reference to the MyObject instance from the obj variable.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: At this point, the MyObject instance is no longer reachable from any active reference in the program, which means it's eligible for garbage collection.
Dhiraj Kumar: ohk
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: just keep in mind , it work in background and collect unused memory,or free unused memory 
Dhiraj Kumar: ohk sir
Dhiraj Kumar: tqq sir..

Suraj Prajapati: Why we use generic because it is working like array (typesafety)
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: you are correct it is use for TypeSafty
Suraj Prajapati: Then why it's used because it's done in array
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: it is used in collection concept, size increase dynamically, it works on Object, not primitive data types
Suraj Prajapati: Okay
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Generics are more flexible
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Generics provide compile-time type-checking
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Generics support parameterized types
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: while arrays provide type-safety, generics are more flexible, provide compile-time type-checking, support parameterized types, and provide type inference, which makes them a more powerful and versatile tool for working with data in Java.

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Use the git rm command to remove the file from your local repository. For example, if you want to remove a file called ""example.txt"", run git rm example.txt.<br /><br />Once you've removed the file locally, commit the change with git commit -m ""Removed example.txt"". This will create a new commit that removes the file from your local repository.

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: rm -rf folder_name<br />
Vishesh Jindal: but by using this command the files are deleted from my folder as well

Vishesh Jindal: ok
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: If you want to keep the files in your local folder but remove them from the Git repository only, you can use the git rm command with the --cached option. Here's an example:
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: git rm -r --cached folder_name<br />

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Hello. How may I help you?

Falguni: Which among the following can show polymorphism?<br /><br />    Overloading ||<br /><br />    Overloading +=<br /><br />    Overloading <<<br /><br />    Overloading &&
Falguni: sir how can we determine the answer?
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Among the options given, overloading || (logical OR) and overloading && (logical AND) can show polymorphism. This is because these operators can be overloaded with different parameter types, allowing them to operate on different data types and produce different results depending on the context in which they are used.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Overloading += (addition assignment) and overloading << (left shift) can also be overloaded with different parameter types, but they may not necessarily demonstrate polymorphism as they are typically used for more specific operations.
Falguni: but sir correct answer is overloading <<
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes it is correct
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: overloading << (left shift) can demonstrate polymorphism
Falguni: but how sir
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: When overloading the << operator, it can be used to perform output operations on different data types. For example, you can overload the << operator for a custom class to allow it to be printed to the console or a file. This allows the operator to behave differently depending on the type of the operand.
Falguni: sir i cant understand this
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: overloading the << operator can demonstrate polymorphism because it allows the operator to behave differently depending on the type of the operand, which is one of the key aspects of polymorphism

Shubham: Hi , sorry my network got some issue earlier, i had a question regarding if, did you have the ans ?
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: can you share code
Shubham sent d311db97-bc29-4e94-bb8b-a307de8cd54c.png 
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: In Java, strings are objects, and when comparing strings using the ""=="" operator, the comparison is done by checking if the two operands refer to the same object in memory, rather than comparing their actual contents.<br /><br />In the given code, the input string is compared using the ""!="" operator with the string ""a"" and ""b"". However, when comparing strings, it is recommended to use the equals() method instead of ""=="" or ""!="" operators.
Shubham: how is it entering the if condition (the condition is false due to AND logically i.e. false AND true = false)
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: if (!input.equals(""a"") && !input.equals(""b"")) {<br />    System.out.println(""it is inside"");<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: import java.util.Scanner;<br /><br />public class Test {<br />    public static void main(String[] args) {<br />        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);<br />        String input = sc.next();<br />        if (!input.equals(""a"") && !input.equals(""b"")) {<br />        System.out.println(""it is inside"");<br />            <br />        }<br />    }<br />}

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Java Collection Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provides a way to store, organize and manipulate groups of objects. The Collection Framework includes interfaces such as List, Set, Queue, and Map, as well as their respective implementations.<br /><br />The Map interface in Java Collection Framework represents a collection of key-value pairs. A Map is an interface that is implemented by HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap classes.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: import java.util.*;<br /><br />public class MapExample {<br />    public static void main(String[] args) {<br />        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();<br />        map.put(""Alice"", 20);<br />        map.put(""Bob"", 25);<br />        map.put(""Charlie"", 30);<br />        System.out.println(map); // Output: {Alice=20, Bob=25, Charlie=30}<br />        System.out.println(map.get(""Bob"")); // Output: 25<br />        map.remove(""Charlie"");<br />        System.out.println(map); // Output: {Alice=20, Bob=25}<br />        System.out.println(map.containsKey(""Charlie"")); // Output: false<br />        System.out.println(map.keySet()); // Output: [Alice, Bob]<br />        System.out.println(map.values()); // Output: [20, 25]<br />    }<br />}<br />

Aishwarya Kumar: sir plzz explain the line no 14
Aishwarya Kumar: str1.setCharAt(i, str.charAt(j));
Aishwarya Kumar: this line sir
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: this line of code takes the character at index j in str and sets it as the new character at index i in str1, effectively replacing the original character at that position.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: str1 is a variable of type StringBuilder or StringBuffer, which are classes in Java used for creating and manipulating mutable strings. In this case, we assume str1 is a StringBuilder object.<br /><br />setCharAt is a method of the StringBuilder or StringBuffer class that allows you to change the character at a specific index in the string.<br /><br />i is an integer variable that represents the index of the character in str1 that you want to modify.<br /><br />str.charAt(j) is a method call that returns the character at a specific index in a different string variable called str. Here, j is an integer variable representing the index of the character you want to retrieve from str.
Aishwarya Kumar: yes sir now i understand
Aishwarya Kumar: i was using str.charAt(i), instead of setCharAt(i)
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: have you any other doubts ask
Aishwarya Kumar: no sir now its clear
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: when you have doubt come on chat support we will help you any time

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Hello. How may I help you?

Rewansh Nagpure: what is difference between join() and synchronized keyword in multithreading
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: join() is a method that allows a thread to wait for another thread to complete its execution before continuing. When a thread invokes join() on another thread, the first thread will wait until the second thread has finished executing before continuing with its own execution. This is useful for situations where one thread depends on the results of another thread.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: synchronized is a keyword used to provide mutual exclusion and ensure that only one thread at a time can execute a block of code or a method. When a thread acquires a lock on an object using the synchronized keyword, other threads attempting to execute the same block of code or method will be blocked until the lock is released. This is useful for situations where multiple threads need to access shared resources or modify shared state.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: join() is used to coordinate the execution of multiple threads in a specific order, while synchronized is used to ensure that only one thread at a time can access a particular block of code or method.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: are you there 
Rewansh Nagpure: yes
Rewansh Nagpure: wait iam just trying to understand this through coding
Rewansh Nagpure: iam not understanding difference between both
Rewansh Nagpure: both are giving same output
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes they will give same output 
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: oin() is a method that allows a thread to wait for another thread to complete its execution
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: only one thread at a time can execute a block of code or a method
Rewansh Nagpure: okay i got it
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: have you any other question
Rewansh Nagpure: no
Rewansh Nagpure: thanks

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Hello. How may I help you?

Sahil: sir if we can only access or read data using iterator so how will we modify it ?
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();<br />myList.add(""apple"");<br />myList.add(""banana"");<br />myList.add(""orange"");<br /><br />ListIterator<String> iterator = myList.listIterator();<br />while (iterator.hasNext()) {<br />    String element = iterator.next();<br />    if (element.equals(""banana"")) {<br />        iterator.set(""pear"");<br />    }<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: iterators provide a way to traverse through a collection of elements, but they do not provide a way to modify the underlying data structure. However, Java provides a few different ways to modify the data while iterating through it.<br /><br />One way to modify data while iterating through it is to use a ListIterator instead of a regular Iterator. ListIterator is a sub-interface of Iterator that allows bidirectional traversal of a List and provides methods to add, set, and remove elements from the list

Niladri Debnath: If we write context.setattribute(k,v), the attribute we can use accross the application... ryt?
Niladri Debnath: And if we write request.setAttribute(k,v)... that attribute will be accessible only for that particular request scope...
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes
Niladri Debnath: What is setparameter?
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: setparameter method (or any method with a similar name) would be specific to the particular framework or library that defines it, and its purpose and usage would depend on the context of that framework or library.
Niladri Debnath: Scope is global or local? For that object for set parameter
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: The scope of a parameter that is set using a setparameter method would depend on the specific implementation of the method and the object it is used on.<br /><br />In some cases, the parameter might have a global scope, meaning it can be accessed and used throughout the entire program or system. In other cases, the parameter might have a local scope, meaning it is only accessible within a specific context or object.
Niladri Debnath: Okk

Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Hello. How may I help you?

Tarun Pandey: what is shadowing problem
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: shadowing"" refers to the practice of declaring a variable within a certain scope that has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. This can lead to confusion because the inner variable ""shadows"" or hides the outer variable within that particular scope
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: int x = 10;<br />if (x > 5) {<br />    int x = 5; // shadowing occurs here<br />    System.out.println(x); // prints 5<br />}<br />System.out.println(x); // prints 10<br />
Tarun Pandey: explain ecapsulation with one proper example
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: public class BankAccount {<br />    private String accountNumber;<br />    private double balance;<br /><br />    public BankAccount(String accountNumber, double balance) {<br />        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;<br />        this.balance = balance;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void deposit(double amount) {<br />        balance += amount;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void withdraw(double amount) {<br />        if (amount <= balance) {<br />            balance -= amount;<br />        } else {<br />            System.out.println(""Insufficient funds"");<br />        }<br />    }<br /><br />    public double getBalance() {<br />        return balance;<br />    }<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: we have a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class has two private attributes: accountNumber and balance. These attributes can only be accessed within the class, and not from outside
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: The class also has three public methods: deposit(), withdraw(), and getBalance(). These methods provide a way to interact with the object's data, without directly accessing the private attributes
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: if we create a BankAccount object and try to access its balance attribute directly from outside the class, we'll get a compile-time error:
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount(""12345"", 1000);<br />double myBalance = myAccount.balance; // Compile-time error: balance has private access in BankAccount<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Instead, we can use the getBalance() method to retrieve the account balance
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: double myBalance = myAccount.getBalance(); // Returns 1000<br />
Tarun Pandey: explain this keyword with example
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh:  this is a keyword that refers to the current object instance. It can be used in a variety of ways, but its primary purpose is to disambiguate between class attributes and method parameters or local variables that have the same name.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: public class Person {<br />    private String name;<br />    private int age;<br /><br />    public Person(String name, int age) {<br />        this.name = name; // Use ""this"" to refer to the instance variable<br />        this.age = age;<br />    }<br /><br />    public void setName(String name) {<br />        this.name = name; // Use ""this"" to disambiguate between the parameter and the instance variable<br />    }<br /><br />    public void setAge(int age) {<br />        this.age = age;<br />    }<br /><br />    public String getInfo() {<br />        return ""Name: "" + this.name + "", Age: "" + this.age; // Use ""this"" to refer to the instance variables<br />    }<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: we have a class called Person with two private attributes: name and age. The class also has a constructor that takes a name and an age parameter, and two setter methods for name and age
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Notice how we use this in the constructor to refer to the instance variables, which helps disambiguate between the constructor parameters and the instance variables.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: We also use this in the setter method for name to disambiguate between the name parameter and the name attribute
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: public static void main(String[] args) {<br />    Person alice = new Person(""Alice"", 25);<br />    System.out.println(alice.getInfo()); // Output: Name: Alice, Age: 25<br /><br />    alice.setAge(26);<br />    alice.setName(""Alice Smith"");<br />    System.out.println(alice.getInfo()); // Output: Name: Alice Smith, Age: 26<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: we create a Person object named alice, and call the getInfo() method to display her name and age. We then use the setAge() and setName() methods to change alice's age and name, respectively, and call getInfo() again to confirm that the changes took effect.
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Have you any other questions
Tarun Pandey: Nope thanks

Sumit Naiya: What is interface in Java with<br /> example
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: an interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants that can be implemented by a class
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: it does not provide any implementation of those methods
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: public interface Animal {<br />    public void makeSound();<br />    public void move();<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: the Dog class implements the Animal interface by providing its own implementation for the makeSound() and move() methods. Now, any code that expects an Animal object can use a Dog object because Dog implements the Animal interface
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: public class Dog implements Animal {<br />    public void makeSound() {<br />        System.out.println(""Bark"");<br />    }<br /><br />    public void move() {<br />        System.out.println(""Walk"");<br />    }<br />}<br />

Shubham Chaudhary: Hello. How may I help you?

Aditya Gupta: Hi
Shubham Chaudhary: Hi, This is Shubham Chaudhary. Thanks for visiting us. How may I assist you?
Aditya Gupta: This is my code on Anagram
Aditya Gupta: import java.util.Arrays;<br />import java.util.Scanner;<br /><br />public class anagram {<br />    public static void main(String[] args) {<br />        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);<br /><br />        String str1=sc.nextLine();<br />        String str2=sc.nextLine();<br /><br />        str1=str1.replaceAll(""\\\\s"", """");<br />        str2=str2.replaceAll(""\\\\s"", """");<br /><br />        str1=str1.toLowerCase();<br />        str2=str2.toLowerCase();<br /><br />        String strArray1[]=null;<br />        String strArray2[]=null;<br /><br />        strArray1=str1.split("""");<br />        strArray2=str2.split("""");<br />        <br />       Arrays.sort(strArray1);<br />       Arrays.sort(strArray2);<br /><br />       String str3=Arrays.toString(strArray1);<br />       String str4=Arrays.toString(strArray1);<br /><br />       if(str3.equals(str4))<br />       {<br />        System.out.println(""Anagrams"");<br />       }<br /><br />       else<br />       {<br />        System.out.println(""Not Anagrams"");<br />       }<br /><br />    }<br />}
Aditya Gupta: Its running
Aditya Gupta: But for every input its showing Anagram only
Aditya Gupta: Can you check

Aditya Gupta: If you want I can explain you my approach briefly
Shubham Chaudhary: wait

Aditya Gupta: Hi
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: let me check your code
Aditya Gupta: Sure
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: import java.util.Arrays;<br />import java.util.Scanner;<br /><br />public class Anagram {<br />    public static void main(String[] args) {<br />        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);<br /><br />        String str1 = sc.nextLine();<br />        String str2 = sc.nextLine();<br /><br />        str1 = str1.replaceAll(""\\\\s"", """");<br />        str2 = str2.replaceAll(""\\\\s"", """");<br /><br />        str1 = str1.toLowerCase();<br />        str2 = str2.toLowerCase();<br /><br />        char[] strArray1 = str1.toCharArray();<br />        char[] strArray2 = str2.toCharArray();<br /><br />        Arrays.sort(strArray1);<br />        Arrays.sort(strArray2);<br /><br />        if (Arrays.equals(strArray1, strArray2)) {<br />            System.out.println(""Anagrams"");<br />        } else {<br />            System.out.println(""Not Anagrams"");<br />        }<br />    }<br />}<br />i have make some changes like
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: The input strings have been converted to char arrays instead of string arrays. This is because the Arrays.equals method compares two arrays element by element, and for strings, it compares the memory addresses instead of the actual characters.
Aditya Gupta: Sorry I didnt get
Aditya Gupta: could you explain again
Aditya Gupta: like at which step I made a mistake
Aditya Gupta: and what?
Aditya Gupta: hi
Aditya Gupta: ?
Aditya Gupta: I understood
Aditya Gupta: just have 2 question
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: ask
Aditya Gupta: Array.equals() in case we were using String arrays would have compared address or inner element?
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: When comparing two String arrays using the equals() method in Java, the comparison is made on the elements of the arrays, not the memory addresses.
Aditya Gupta: No
Aditya Gupta: not equals
Aditya Gupta: I am asking for Array.equals
Aditya Gupta: Arrays.equals(strArray1,strArray2)
Aditya Gupta: Here we have strArray1 and 2 as char Arrays
Aditya Gupta: But what if we had String arrays
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: element in it
Aditya Gupta: Okay
Aditya Gupta: and another doubt
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: String str4=Arrays.toString(strArray1);<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: you have made mistake here
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: strArray2
Aditya Gupta: what was the mistake?
Aditya Gupta: In case of char array I used String array
Aditya Gupta: In case you are busy you can tranfer this doubt
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: i am here 
Aditya Gupta: what was the mistake?
Aditya Gupta: I just used String Arrays instead of char Arrays
Aditya Gupta: suppose word 1 is
Aditya Gupta: theclassroom
Aditya Gupta: 2nd word is
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: import java.util.Arrays;<br />import java.util.Scanner;<br /><br />public class Anagram {<br />public static void main(String[] args) {<br />Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);<br /><br />String str1=sc.nextLine();<br />String str2=sc.nextLine();<br /><br />str1=str1.replaceAll(""\\\\\\\\s"", """");<br />str2=str2.replaceAll(""\\\\\\\\s"", """");<br /><br />str1=str1.toLowerCase();<br />str2=str2.toLowerCase();<br /><br />String strArray1[]=null;<br />String strArray2[]=null;<br /><br />strArray1=str1.split("""");<br />strArray2=str2.split("""");<br /><br />Arrays.sort(strArray1);<br />Arrays.sort(strArray2);<br /><br />String str3=Arrays.toString(strArray1);<br />String str4=Arrays.toString(strArray2);<br /><br />if(str3.equals(str4))<br />{<br />System.out.println(""Anagrams"");<br />}<br /><br />else<br />{<br />System.out.println(""Not Anagrams"");<br />}<br /><br />}<br />}<br />
Aditya Gupta: schoolmaster
Aditya Gupta: what did you correct in this
Aditya Gupta: Its seems same like I wrote
Aditya Gupta: and its running fine now
Aditya Gupta: Can you tell me the correction
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: just String str4=Arrays.toString(strArray2);
Aditya Gupta: I wrote strArray1>
Aditya Gupta: ?
Aditya Gupta: in both?
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: yes

Sumit Naiya: what is the difference between abstraction and interface
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: abstraction is the concept of hiding implementation details, while an interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. An abstract class can provide both abstract and non-abstract methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods.

Sumit Naiya: what is downcasting process in java with example
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Downcasting in Java is the process of converting a reference of a super class type to a reference of a sub class type. This is possible only when the object being referred to is actually of the sub class type
Sumit Naiya: can u give an example with syntax
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: class Animal {<br />   public void sound() {<br />      System.out.println(""Animal is making a sound"");<br />   }<br />}<br /><br />class Dog extends Animal {<br />   public void sound() {<br />      System.out.println(""Dog is barking"");<br />   }<br />   <br />   public void fetch() {<br />      System.out.println(""Dog is fetching a ball"");<br />   }<br />}<br /><br />public class Main {<br />   public static void main(String[] args) {<br />      Animal animal = new Dog(); // upcasting<br />      animal.sound(); // outputs ""Dog is barking""<br />      <br />      // Downcasting<br />      Dog dog = (Dog) animal;<br />      dog.fetch(); // outputs ""Dog is fetching a ball""<br />      <br />      // Attempt to downcast to wrong type<br />      // This will result in a ClassCastException at runtime<br />      // Cat cat = (Cat) animal;<br />   }<br />}<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: Downcasting in variables refers to the process of converting a variable of a wider or more general data type to a variable of a narrower or more specific data type
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: double num = 3.14;<br />int intNum = (int) num; // downcasting<br />System.out.println(intNum);<br />
Aatef Sadeque Shaikh: int i = 10;<br />byte b = (byte) i; // downcasting<br />System.out.println(b);<br />
Sumit Naiya: thanks

Sumit Naiya: No thats it
